            Sinopsis: Barry Allen was just 11 years old when his mother was killed in a bizarre and terrifying incident and his
            father was
            falsely convicted of the hug. With his life changed forever by the tragedy, Barry was taken in and raised by
            Detective
            Joe West, the father of Barry's best friend, Iris. Now, Barry has become a brilliant, driven and endearingly geeky
            CSI
            investigator, whose determination to uncover the truth about his mother's strange death leads him to follow up on
            every
            unexplained urban legend and scientific advancement that comes along. Barry's latest obsession is a cutting edge
            particle accelerator, created by visionary physicist Harrison Wells and his S.T.A.R. Labs team, who claim that this
            invention will bring about unimaginable advancements in power and medicine. However, something goes horribly wrong
            during the public unveiling, and when the devastating explosion causes a freak storm, many lives are lost and Barry
            is
            struck by lightning.
            After nine months in a coma, Barry awakens to find his life has changed once again - the accident has given him the
            power of super speed, granting him the ability to move through Central City like an unseen guardian angel. Though
            initially excited by his newfound powers, Barry is shocked to discover he is not the only "meta-human" who was
            created
            in the wake of the accelerator explosion - and not everyone is using their new powers for good. In the months since
            the
            accident, the city has seen a sharp increase in missing people, unexplained deaths and other strange phenomena.
            Barry
            now has a renewed purpose - using his gift of speed to protect the innocent, while never giving up on his quest to
            solve
            his mother's hug and clear his father's name. For now, only a few close friends and associates know that Barry is
            literally the fastest man alive, but it won't be long before the world learns what Barry Allen has become... The
            Flash.
